The finishing was sharp, clean, and perfectly balanced. Every line and detail was up to the mark and came out exactly as I had envisioned. The studio was professional and comfortable throughout. Highly recommend Kaal Chakra Tattoo Studio and Sumit Tank for quality work, precision, and true craftsmanship.",
